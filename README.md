# Data-Analysis-with-Python
Learn the basics of Python, Numpy, Pandas, Data Visualization, and Exploratory Data Analysis. This was originally presented as a live course.

By the end of the course, you will be able to build an end-to-end real-world course project. There are no prerequisites for this course.

This full course includes 3 lectures:

* Analyzing Tabular Data with Pandas
* Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Exploratory Data Analysis - A Case Study
